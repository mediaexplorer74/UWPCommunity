# UWPCommunity 1.3 -- uno branch
My fork of [UWPCommunityApp project](https://github.com/WindowsAppCommunity/UWPCommunityApp) for some micro-RnD (i.e., w10m compatibility, or old androids...).

# About
A companion app for the [UWP Community website](https://uwpcommunity.com). I planned to "return" (flashback) W10M compatibility... or research some old Android deals ;)
