# Dev Story
Howdy! I'm Joshua Askharoun, the developer of the UWP Community companion app. For Launch 2019, I designed icons for a few of the participating apps. This year, on top of designing icons, I'm participating with my own app.

Not long after Launch 2019, Arlo and Emiliano built the UWP Community website. Naturally, as the UWP Community, the next logical step was to make a UWP client for the website. This app primarily showcases other apps that prove how useful and powerful the Universal Windows Platform is, while being such an example itself.

For instance, the client includes the XAML Llama's stream game, Llama Bingo (or "Llamingo"). This game utilizes several UWP-specific APIs, including share tasks, protocol activation, and UI element bitmap rendering. These APIs easily allow for small improvements to be made, which eventually stacks up to an overall better user experience.
I look forward to furthering this vision as both the UWP Community and its website grow.
