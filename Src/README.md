## Contributors' guide
If you wish to make contributions or checkout in-development features, we recommend cloning the `dev` branch.
The `master` branch is intended to be the current state of the current version of the app available in the Microsoft Store.
The `dev` branch is the next update for the Store version. Any other branches are for specific features that aren't targeting
the next release, or are completely experimental.

**Please, do not commit or merge directly into the `master` branch!**
